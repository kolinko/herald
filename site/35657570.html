    <h2>Greenland's Disappearing Act</h2>
    <p><em>By Olivia "The Dreamer" Thompson - Junior Reporter</em></p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 23 Apr 2023</p>
    <b><i>The meltdown of Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets has reached alarming proportions, revealing the Earth's most colossal cryo-con. In a panic-inducing trajectory, human-induced climate change has propelled ice loss to an unprecedented rate, turning the once-infamous ice-invincible Greenland into a quickly vanishing illusion.

    <p>Step right up, everyone, to experience the greatest disappearing act of our time: "Greenland’s Disappearing Act: Meltdown Exposes Earth's Biggest Cryo-Con!" Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be astounded as you bear witness to the rapid meltdown of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Submerging major cities one millimeter at a time, this outstanding – and terrifying – show displays the disastrous effects of human-induced climate change.
<p>
The performance kicks off with Greenland ice loss skyrocketing, reaching an average annual melt from 2017 to 2020 that was 20% more than at the beginning of the decade and a whopping seven times higher than its annual shrinkage in the early 1990s. And it doesn't stop there, oh no, did you think we'd leave Antarctica out of the show? Absolutely not! Starting from 1992-1996, our act presents the two ice sheets, which hold 99% of the world's freshwater ice, shrinking by a mere 116 billion tons a year. However, fast forward to 2017-2020, and witness how the melting has escalated up to an astounding 410 billion tons a year.
<p>
Buckle up because it only gets bolder from here! The real twist creates a shocking sense of urgency, as scientists have recently identified that at the current rate, the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets could contribute to a whopping one-quarter of the total global sea-level rise. But let us not forget the contribution of warmer water expanding and melt from glaciers, for they, too, play a significant role in this earth-shattering performance. 
<p>
Brace yourselves, folks, as every disappearing act needs a grand finale! What we're revealing today is that since 1992, Earth has lost an astonishing 8.3 trillion tons of ice, enough to flood the entire United States with 33.6 inches of water or submerge France in 49 feet! To put this into perspective, it takes the world's oceans and physicists.org website's accessibility level to the depths of the Mariana Trench. As we turn the lights down low, heed this final warning: don't let the great disappearing ice act fool you, for it is very much an alarming reality that cannot be unperformed!</p>
