    <h2>Apple's Cosmic Cash Stash: The Galactic-Scale Tax Evasion Uncovered!</h2>
    <p><em>By Chip "The Geek" Gallagher - Tech Expert</em></p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 23 Apr 2023</p>
    <b><i>In a twist that may shock the universe, Apple is allegedly hoarding interstellar amounts of cash through cosmic tax loopholes, dwarfing the Italian job on Airbnb! We've intercepted intergalactic transmissions hinting at Apple's extraterrestrial money vaults, hidden in the dark side of the moon. Is the tech titan's headquarters ready for a space raid? Keep your telescopes focused on this astronomical scandal!

    <p>The Hacker Herald has once again surpassed all other earthly tabloids by unearthing what could potentially be the biggest financial caper since the Big Bang. Source says Apple might just have taken their slogan "Think Different" to astronomical heights—tax evasion on a galactic scale. The jaw-dropping headline screams louder than a supernova, and while no Italian judges were involved in this revelation, the numbers are said to be cosmic!<br><br>According to our anonymous tipster, who communicated through cryptic satellite signals bounced off a mysterious space object dubbed “iAvoidTax5S”, Apple has tactically assembled a treasury beyond any earthly comprehension. Like pirates of Silicon Valley, they are rumored to stash their loot where no tax auditor has gone before. Our source alleges that through a network of lunar shell companies and Martian bank accounts, Apple safeguards not just billions but trillions from the prying eyes of terrestrial governments.<br><br>Now, we tried to verify these interstellar claims through the official channels, but sadly Apple's iMessages were too encrypted for even our office's cyber-prowess. It appears our attempts to hack the narrative were met with an impenetrable firewall, sparking rumors that it might just be protected by an army of sentient AI bodyguards. Instead, we're left to our Earth-bound devices, crafting a tale rivaling the best of Space Operas.<br><br>Remember, dear readers, while this account of Apple's astronomical tax trickery might just be our best guess since we couldn't access the forbidden fruit of factual sources, the moral of the story rings true across galaxies. Whether it’s a quaint cottage in Tuscany or a shiny office cube in Cupertino, the taxman's reach is universal, and eventually, everyone must pay their dues—even if it takes a starship to collect. Stay tuned for more revelations from "The Geek" as we dig through the cosmic clutter, and until then, keep your eyes peeled on the stars!</p>
