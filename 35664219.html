    <b><i>Tech-savvy feathered friends learn to hold video calls, leading to the beginning of some unlikely friendships and new skills, according to researchers from Northeastern University, MIT, and the University of Glasgow.
</b></i>
    <p>Hold the birdseed, as parrots are flocking to join the latest technological trend by mastering video calls like Zoom and FaceTime, replacing their usual chirps and squawks with virtual tete-a-tetes. The groundbreaking study conducted by the bird-loving boffins at Northeastern University, MIT, and the University of Glasgow has unlocked the door to what might just be the future of parrot-human-computer interaction.
<p>
The birds went wild for the video calls, and according to their meticulous researchers, they not only appeared to understand that they were conversing with real fellow parrots, but they also had a squawking good time! This monumental study found that some parrots even learned new skills from their digital brothers-in-beak, such as foraging and other vocalizations. Never underestimate the power of a winged friend joining the 21st century.
<p>
Birds across a whole range of species were taught to use cutting-edge technology, using tablets and smartphones on Facebook Messenger to call one another. And guess what? These wing-surfing wizards didn't disappoint. Our fine-feathered friends seemed to take like ducks to water, as caretakers were overwhelmed with avian appreciation; their parrots elated at mastering the digital medium. It seems like the social dynamic of today's parrot has truly evolved.
<p>
These parrots have proven that videos are for the birds, and they love it. Word has it that they not only engaged in most of the calls for the maximum allowed time but also had strong preferences for certain parrot-friends. So next time you think about leaving your pet parrot behind while you video chat with friends, remember these flying stars have shown they have a penchant for tech too. The parrots have spoken, and video calls have truly taken flight.</p>
