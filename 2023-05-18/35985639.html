    <h2>Meta Fined Record Amount: Ireland Strikes Hard!</h2>
    <p><em>By Felicity "Scoop" Sanders - Senior Reporter</em></p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> 23 Apr 2023</p>
    <b><i>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) cracks down on Meta with a record-breaking privacy fine for failing to protect user data transferred to the United States, delivering a significant blow to the social media giant and setting a precedence for the future of data sharing across the Atlantic.
</b></i>
    <p>In an unprecedented act of defiance against the social media Goliaths, Ireland's Data Protection Commission has slapped Meta Platforms, the owners of Facebook, with the largest privacy fine in European Union history. The DPC is taking Meta to task for ignoring a top court warning aimed at safeguarding users' data from the nosy intrusions of US security services when their data crosses the Atlantic. With unmatched bravado, the DPC is not only crushing Meta with this enormous fine but ordering the social network to halt all data transfers to the US that rely on questionably insecure contractual clauses.<br><br>This Meta penalty has shattered the previous privacy fine record of €746 million held by online shopping behemoth, Amazon. In a dramatic, tangled, multi-year saga, Facebook, alongside thousands of other companies, were plunged into legal chaos. EU judges in 2020 threw out an EU decision regulating transatlantic data flows, citing concerns that citizens' data was vulnerable once it reached the US. Although they didn't quash an alternative contractual tool, their skepticism regarding American data protection led to a preliminary order from the Irish authority informing Facebook that it could no longer shift data to the US through this method either.<br><br>Meta had previously threatened a complete withdrawal from the EU if a data-transfer ban was implemented, showcasing the immeasurable gravity of this situation. Surprisingly, the Irish decision only targets Meta's Facebook and does not impact other Meta services like Instagram or other firms that transfer data in the same manner. It is expected that Meta will take advantage of a transition period and launch an appeal in Irish courts, possibly banking on the success of a new transatlantic data pact the EU is currently negotiating with the US.<br><br>The controversy surrounding this showdown dates back to 2013, in the aftermath of former contractor Edward Snowden exposing the intrusive tentacles of the US National Security Agency. Privacy advocate Max Schrems has been challenging Facebook in Ireland, where the social media giant has its European base, asserting that EU citizens' data is jeopardized the instant it sets foot on US soil. Now, with the Hacker Herald bringing to light the epic battle between Ireland and Meta, the cyber-world will keep a keen eye on the unfolding data drama and its reverberations throughout the tech realm.</p>
